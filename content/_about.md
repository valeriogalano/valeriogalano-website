# More than 20 Years of Code. Head in the Cloud. Hands in AI.

When I wrote my first line of **PHP**, the "Cloud" was just someone else's computer, and connecting to the internet meant hogging the phone line. But no, I've never worked with punch cards: I'm not that old.

In over **20 years of development**, I’ve seen technologies born and die, but I’ve stuck to one philosophy: write software that solves problems, not one that creates new ones. I’m not here to sell you buzzwords; I’m here to build solid solutions.

**Here is what I bring to your project:**

* **PHP & WordPress (The serious kind):** Forget amateurs who install random plugins. I transform **PHP** into a high-performance engine and bend **WordPress** to enterprise logic, making it secure and fast.
* **Cloud Architectures:** Perfect code is useless if the server crashes. I design scalable architectures in the **Cloud** because your business needs to handle the traffic, not just "hope for the best."
* **Artificial Intelligence (Because it has to be said):** Let’s be honest, today if you don't mention **AI**, you're nobody. But I don't use it as a magic spell: I integrate AI into workflows to optimize code, automate boring processes, and analyze data. Basically, I use it to work smarter and deliver your project sooner.

**Why should you choose me?**
Because experience is the only thing you can't download from GitHub. In two decades, I have already made (and fixed) the mistakes a junior developer is about to make on your site.

If you are looking for someone who combines "old school" wisdom with the power of **AI** and the **Cloud**, stop looking. Let's talk about your project.
