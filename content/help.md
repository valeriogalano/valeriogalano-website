This page explains how navigation with `j`/`k` works and how to use the Vim‑style command line.

Navigation with `j` and `k`

- Use `j`/`k` to move forward/backward through the links on the page; press `Enter` to open the highlighted link.
- The active link is visually highlighted and scrolled minimally into view. If it has `target="_blank"`, it opens in a new tab.
- Footer status shows `pos:tot` (e.g., `3:12`). Press `Esc` or click anywhere on the page to clear the selection (back to `0:tot`).
- On mobile, two buttons `j` and `k` replicate the respective keyboard shortcuts.

Using the command line (`:`)

- Press `:` on any page to open the command input at the bottom.
- Type a command with or without the leading `:` (both work), then press `Enter` to execute.
- Press `Esc` to close the command line without executing.
- If you press `Backspace` when the caret is right after `:`, the command line closes automatically.
- On mobile there is a `cmd` button that simulates pressing `:` and opens the command input.
